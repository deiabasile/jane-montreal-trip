          Montréal is the largest city in Canada's Québec province. This
          French-speaking city is considered the cultural capital of Canada, and
          is a cosmopolitan celebration of Québécois style. A stroll around the
          cobblestone streets and grand buildings of Vieux-Montréal will give
          you a taste of European flavour. The Basilique Notre-Dame is a
          confection of stained glass, and the Plateau Mont-Royal district will
          delight with its quaint boutiques and cafés. Dig in to a massive plate
          of poutine to fuel up for a tour of the epic Olympic Park.
