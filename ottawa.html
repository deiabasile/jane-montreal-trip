        <p>
          Ottawa is Canada’s capital, in the east of southern Ontario, near the
          city of Montréal and the U.S. border. Sitting on the Ottawa River, it
          has at its centre Parliament Hill, with grand Victorian architecture
          and museums such as the National Gallery of Canada, with noted
          collections of indigenous and other Canadian art. The park-lined
          Rideau Canal is filled with boats in summer and ice-skaters in winter.
